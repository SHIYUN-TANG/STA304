We cannot deny that society continues to evolve and undergo rapid changes, and thus it is not unusual that
people nowadays are under tremendous pressure. As more and more people have been diagnosed with mental
health disorders, the self-rated well-being of Canadians remains an ongoing interest. In particular, we are
interested in how some specific family-related factors affect Canadians’ feelings of life as a whole. In this
report, we will build a linear regression model between Canadian’s feelings about life as a whole and their
age, number of children, family income, average number of hours worked per week and age at first marriage.
According to our model, it is family income that has the most significant effect on Canadians’ feelings about
life. Age and age at first marriage can also influence Canadians’ feelings about life, but the effect is minor.
Therefore, we conclude that in order to effectively improve people’s well-being, the Canadian government
should strive for a more prosperous economy so that there will be an increase in family income among all
Canadians.
